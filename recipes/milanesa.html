        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Often referred to as Argentina's unofficial national dish, milanesa is a humble,
             yet delicious meal consisting of a breaded slice of prime beef that is fried in hot oil, 
            curling up as it cooks, due to the fact that the chosen cuts of meat have less fat and sinew than other cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some claim that the best milanesa in Buenos Aires will always be prepared at home, cooked by someone's mother, 
            although many restaurants also have it on their menus. For the pure, basic experience, 
            it is enough to squeeze some lemon juice over it, but it is often served with a side of 
            creamy mashed potatoes or french fries
