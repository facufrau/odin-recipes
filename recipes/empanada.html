        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, about 8 minutes. 
                Drain. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into cubes. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet and cook onion and spring onions until softened, about 5 minutes. 
                Add bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. 
                Add ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Season with paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove beef mixture from heat, add potatoes and olives, and mix well. 
                Stir in chopped hard-boiled eggs and set filling aside to cool, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly grease with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place an empanada pastry round on a flat surface and lightly wet edges with warm water. 
                Put a large tablespoon of cooled filling in the center and fold pastry over. 
                Seal edges by pressing with a fork. Repeat with remaining rounds and filling. 
                Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg.
